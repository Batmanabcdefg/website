<p><img src="static/img/me.png" alt="My face" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a MSc student in Condensed Matter Theory the Department of Physics at McGill University. My specific interests are in solidification of pure and alloy systems including the following topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Novel kinetic pathways in alloy systems</li>
<li>Formation of secondary phases and other nonequilibrium phases</li>
<li>Building quantitive theories of solidification at diffusive time scales</li>
<li>Computational methods for Nonlinear Langevin equations</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in these, or other, topics in classical condensed matter check our the works of my advisor and others in the research group <a href="http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~provatas/.index.html">here</a></p>
